## About ParaLibrary

ParaLibrary was developed to allow users to turn their personal
libraries into public ones. The system allows you to log and organize
what physical books you own in a digitized version of your personal home
library. You can then view your friends or neighbors libraries and make
requests to borrow books from them. You can coordinate lending books to
your friends, seeing what have been requested and what has been loaned
out.

ParaLibrary took inspiration from programs such as Little Free Library
that make books available to anyone. However, we wanted to give the user
more oversite since you may want to share a book you love with someone
else but still like to know where it is. It's also a great tool if you
just want to keep track of all the books in your house!
